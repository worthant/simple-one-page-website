# 🌐 Web-Programming Course

Welcome to the Web-Programming Course repository. This repo contains a series of lab work projects that span across various concepts in Web Programming. Each lab work resides in its own directory with dedicated README files containing the respective instructions and requirements.

👇 An overview of the labs included in this course:

| Laboratory Work              | Grade | Difficulty | Time Spent | Key Concepts | Materials |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- |
| [Laboratory Work №1](./lab1) |       |            |            |              |           |
| [Laboratory Work №2](./lab2) |       |            |            |              |           |
| [Laboratory Work №3](./lab3) |       |            |            |              |           |
| [Laboratory Work №4](./lab4) |       |            |            |              |           |

_I'll be updating the Grade, Difficulty, Time Spent, Key Concepts, and Materials for each lab work as I progress through the course._
